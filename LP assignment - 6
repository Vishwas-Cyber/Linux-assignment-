1) Which command is used to list the contents of a directory?
The most common command to list what’s inside a directory is ls. By default, if you type ls, it will show you all the files and subdirectories in the current working directory.
Examples:
•	ls → shows names of files in the current folder.
•	ls -l → shows details like file permissions, owner, size, and modification date in a long list format.
•	ls -a → includes hidden files (those starting with a dot).
•	ls -lh → human-readable sizes (like 5K, 2M, 1G).
So, ls is not just about listing names—it can also give a lot of details depending on the options used. It’s the go-to tool to “see what’s in here.”

2) Write the command to create a new directory named 123test_dir.
The command is:
mkdir 123test_dir
This makes a new folder with that name in the current location. If you want to create multiple nested directories at once (like abc/xyz), you add -p:
mkdir -p abc/xyz
That way you don’t get errors if the parent directory doesn’t exist.

3) What is the purpose of the sed command?
sed stands for Stream Editor. It processes text line by line and can perform operations like find-and-replace, deletion, insertion, or printing. It’s super useful for quickly editing text in files without opening them manually.
Example: Replace all occurrences of “Linux” with “Unix” in file.txt:
sed 's/Linux/Unix/g' file.txt
Here s means substitute, and g means “replace globally in each line.”
Another example: Delete line 3 from a file:
sed '3d' file.txt
So, sed is basically like a robot editor—you tell it the rule, and it applies it automatically across the file.

4) Which distinct command is used to display one-line descriptions of any commands?
The whatis command.
For example:
whatis ls
It’s useful when you already know the command name but want to quickly check what it does without reading the full manual.

5) Write the command to create an empty file named notes.txt.
There are two common ways:
touch notes.txt
or
> notes.txt
The first (touch) updates the file timestamp or creates the file if it doesn’t exist. The second way (>) creates an empty file by redirecting nothing into it. Both result in a blank file.

6) Differentiate between grep and awk with an example.
•	grep: mainly for searching patterns inside text.
Example:
grep "error" logfile.txt
This prints all lines in logfile.txt that contain the word “error.”
•	awk: more powerful, can search but also process fields in each line.
Example:
awk '{print $1, $3}' logfile.txt
This prints only the 1st and 3rd column from each line (useful for structured data like CSVs).
So: grep = search tool, awk = mini programming language for text processing.

7) Write the command to give read, write, and execute permission to the owner of a file script.sh.
chmod u+rwx script.sh
Here u means user (owner), and +rwx means add read, write, and execute. After this, the owner can do everything with the file.

8) How is chown different from chgrp? Give one example each.
•	chown changes the owner of a file.
Example:
chown alice report.txt
Now alice is the new owner.
•	chgrp changes only the group of a file.
Example:
chgrp staff report.txt
Now the group that has access is staff.
So, chown = who owns the file. chgrp = which group the file belongs to.

9) A user complains they cannot execute a file even though it exists. How to troubleshoot?
Steps:
1.	Run ls -l filename → check permissions. If execute (x) is missing, that explains it.
2.	Use whoami → see which user is running the command. If the file is owned by someone else and “others” have no execute permission, that user can’t run it.
3.	Fix with chmod +x filename → this adds execute permission.
So the issue usually comes down to permission bits and ownership mismatch.

10) Command pipeline to find all .log files modified in the last 2 days in /var/log, show them, and save results into recent_logs.txt
find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime -2 | tee recent_logs.txt
Explanation:
•	find /var/log -name "*.log" → locate all .log files.
•	-mtime -2 → only files modified in the last 2 days.
•	tee recent_logs.txt → prints the results on screen and saves them to a file.
This way you don’t miss anything—you see it live, and you also have a saved copy.
