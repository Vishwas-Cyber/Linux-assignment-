1) What is a shell in Linux OS? How many categories of shell exist? Why Bash is popular? 
A shell is the command-line interpreter that connects the user to the Linux operating system. It reads user commands, passes them to the kernel, and displays output. It can also run scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
Categories of shells:
1.	Bourne Shell family (sh-based):
o	sh (original Bourne shell)
o	bash (Bourne Again Shell)
o	dash (Debian Almquist Shell)
o	ksh (Korn shell)
o	zsh (Z shell)
2.	C Shell family (csh-based):
o	csh (C Shell)
o	tcsh (Tenex C Shell)
Why Bash is popular:
•	Default in almost all Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL, etc.)
•	Combines Bourne shell syntax with C-shell features.
•	Provides strong scripting capabilities, command history, auto-completion, and arrays.
•	Backward-compatible with traditional shell scripts.
•	Open source and actively maintained by GNU.

2) What does the ls -Z command display?
ls -Z shows SELinux security contexts for files and directories.
Example:
ls -Z /home
Output format:
-rw-r--r--. user user unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 file.txt
Here, the part unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 is the SELinux context, indicating the security user, role, type, and level.

3) Command to list all hidden files in current directory 
ls -a
or to show only hidden files:
ls -d .*
Explanation: In Linux, hidden files start with a dot (.). The -a option lists all files, including hidden ones.

4) Difference between hard links and soft (symbolic) links 
Feature	Hard Link	Soft (Symbolic) Link
Definition	Direct reference to the same inode as the original file	Shortcut pointing to the original file’s path
Inode	Shares the same inode	Has its own inode
Works across file systems	No	Yes
If original is deleted	Hard link still works	Soft link breaks
Creation	ln file1 file2	ln -s file1 file2
Example:
ln file.txt copy.txt      
ln -s file.txt shortcut

5) File permission -rwxr-x--x explained
Type	Owner	Group	Others
Permissions	rwx	r-x	--x
Meaning	Owner can read, write, execute	Group can read and execute	Others can only execute
So:
•	Owner: full control (read/write/execute)
•	Group: can read and execute, but not modify
•	Others: can only execute (no read or write)

6) Command to change group ownership of a file data.txt to group staff 
chgrp staff data.txt
or using sudo if you lack permission:
sudo chgrp staff data.txt
________________________________________
7) Why giving 777 permissions is dangerous 
chmod 777 means:
•	Owner, group, and others all have read, write, and execute access.
Example:
chmod 777 script.sh
Any user can modify or replace script.sh. If malicious code is inserted, it can execute with your privileges.
Best practice: Use least privilege — e.g. chmod 755 for executable scripts.

8) Difference between apropos (man -k) and whatis (man -f) (CO1)
Command	Purpose	Example
whatis	Shows a one-line description of a specific command	whatis ls
apropos	Searches for commands related to a keyword	apropos list
apropos does a keyword search across all man page descriptions, while whatis looks up a specific name match.

9) Redirect error output to error.log 
Use file descriptor 2 (standard error):
command 2> error.log
Example:
ls /root 2> error.log
This writes permission-denied errors into error.log.
________________________________________
10) Use of tee to append output to a file instead of overwriting
By default, tee overwrites the file. Use -a to append:
command | tee -a output.log
Example:
echo "New log entry" | tee -a system.log
This prints to terminal and appends the same text to system.log.
